Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted EDA to gain an initial understanding of the data. This involved generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying any correlations between variables.

Feature Selection: To identify features with the most potential impact on sales, we employed various feature selection techniques, such as correlation analysis and statistical tests.

Visualization: We created visualizations, including charts and graphs, to present our findings in a clear and easily understandable manner.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests were used to determine the significance of relationships between features and sales. This helped us prioritize the most influential factors.
